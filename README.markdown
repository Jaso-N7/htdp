# Htdp - Learning How to Design Programs

## About

This is practice from both edX's (UBCx HtC1x) How to Code: Simple Data and most of the exercises from the books HtDP/1e & HtDP/2e

## Installation

`(ql:quickload '(:ptester :htdp))`

### Testing

`(asdf:test-system :htdp)`

If time permits, I would also like to implement Property-Based testing.
